// All functions were written based on the following document:
// http://docs.cs.up.ac.za/programming/asm/derick_tut/syscalls.html

// This source file was defined because during the debugging of this
// kernel, there's a lot of times where it will be compiled as ELF.
// This ELF executable is actually understood by linux (as a statically
// compiled binary) and therefore I have defined a few small functions
// to give us just enough to write to the user's terminal and exit.
// 
// Maybe in the future I might make the kernel run as user-mode emulation
// so I can test different functionality without needing to use KVM/QEMU
// but for now, this is all.
